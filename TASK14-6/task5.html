    <p>What is Lorem Ipsum? <br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesettingindustry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummytext ever since the 1500s, <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, <br> but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
